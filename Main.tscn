If you want to use footstools, you have to instance one in the scene and set up a collision shape for it.
 Then in the editor, you configure the footstools push_other's y value to whatever amount you want pushback.

Note: ChimneyDescent1 has an example. Turn on visible collisions in Debug to see it."
